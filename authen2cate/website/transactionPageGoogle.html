        <h1>_Welcome Back Hacker_</h1>
        <div id="mission spec">
		Rico was a bit safer in terms of his account, he used his own domain to help make his email more difficult to guess and also used a longer
		password, "zetasarethebestgang." You don't need special characters or numbers to make a strong password! In fact, a password like "correctbatteryhorsestaple"
		is more difficult for computers to guess than a "hard" password like Tr0ub4d0r&3, despite having no numbers and eing much easier to remember.
		When it comes to passwords, their length is much more important than how many weird symbols they use!

		<div id="mission spec">Your objctive is to hack into the Foogle Games Foogle account to disrupt the hacking activities of
		the tired, delirious, hallucinating students that came to hack. The orchestrators of the event are tech-savvy, however, and
		use sophisticated 2-step authentication. You have a feeling that task is going to be harder than the others.

		<ol>
			<li>We have reason to believe that the username of the account is the current CEO of a knockoff company, Google.com</li>
			<li>We also think that the password is the location of the first ever 24Hours Of Food.</li>
