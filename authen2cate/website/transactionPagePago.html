		Man, that Tim Cook, huh? What an idiot to reuse email addresses on multiple sites! That makes you so much closer
		to getting into their account! Even if you don't have multiple email accounts, many modern email clients will allow
		you to add + to your standard email, such as youremail+bookface@email.com. This allows you have multiple "different"
		accounts for each website you sign up for but all the messages get sent to the same email, which is convenient for you!
